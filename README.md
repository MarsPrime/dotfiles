To make Debian (or other Linux distributions) looks like this:

| file                | destination                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **i3/config**       | i3 config file with all keybindings       |
| **i3/bumblebee.sh** | Script to show bumblebee status bar in i3 |

I use 3 languages:
- Russian
- English
- Japanese
For using this languages my Linux has Fcitx5(IME system for Linux). To use this I use this scripts:

| file        | destination         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| **/fcitx**  | File for dbus       |
| **/fcitx5** | Base config for IME |
